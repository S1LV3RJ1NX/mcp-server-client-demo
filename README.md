# Model Context Protocol (MCP)

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a powerful framework that enables developers to build AI applications with large language models (LLMs) by providing a standardized way to connect models with external data sources and tools.

## MCP Server

This repository contains the code for setting up a demo MCP server with Server Side Events (SSE) and Auto tool registry with `@mcp_tool` decorator. Refer to the [server](server/README.md) for more details.

## MCP Client

This repository contains the code for setting up a demo MCP client with OpenAI SDK. Refer to the [client](client/README.md) for more details.

> Note: For ease of understanding, both server and client are in the same repository, you can easily keep them in separate repositories / projects.
